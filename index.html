      <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><time datetime="1914">1914</time></strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
        <li><strong><time datetime="1933">1933</time></strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of
          Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
        <li><strong><time datetime="1935">1935</time></strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the
          Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this
          left scars on me."</li>
        <li><strong><time datetime="1937">1937</time></strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry
          Service</li>
        <li><strong><time datetime="1938">1938</time></strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off
          due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches
          him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
        <li><strong><time datetime="1941">1941</time></strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor
          attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control
          malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
        <li><strong><time datetime="1942">1942</time></strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
        <li><strong><time datetime="1944">1944</time></strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves
          behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years,
          his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each
          major climate on Earth.</li>
        <li><strong><time datetime="1945">1945</time></strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season,
          doubling wheat yields</li>
        <li><strong><time datetime="1953">1953</time></strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a
          high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of
          Mexico's wheat.</li>
        <li><strong><time datetime="1962">1962</time></strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of
          wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding
          population</li>
        <li><strong><time datetime="1970">1970</time></strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
        <li><strong><time datetime="1983">1983</time></strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase
          their maize and sorghum yields</li>
        <li><strong><time datetime="1984">1984</time></strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M
          University</li>
        <li><strong><time datetime="2005">2005</time></strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by
          2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable
          land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and
          animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
        <li><strong><time datetime="2009">2009</time></strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
      </ul>
